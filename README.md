# Professional Programming Tools for C and C++: Example Code

Code samples from the book *Professional Programming Tools for C and C++* by Anton Gerdelan and Katja Å½ibrek.

## Repository Structure

* This repository is split into folders, one for each code example.
* Folders are numbered after the corresponding book chapter, and then by order of appearance within the chapter.
* Code snippets from each chapter are put into a stand-alone program with a `main()` function.
* Most examples comprise just a single file called `main.c` and should be straight-forward to compile with any compiler.
Some examples have a `main.cpp` and should be compiled with a C++ compiler.
* Some examples require command line arguments to run, such as the file name of an image to open.
* See comments at the top of source code for further compilation and running instructions.

For example, to build the first assertions example with GCC and run it from a terminal:

```
cd ch1_00_assertions
gcc -o my_program main.c
./my_program
```

In Visual Studio create a new project and drag the appropriate `.c` files into your source code tree before building.
