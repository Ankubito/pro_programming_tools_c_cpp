# Contribution Guidelines

Please feel encouraged to make a pull request (PR) to correct or clarify code.

Some rough guidelines for making a PR:

* Bug fixes and operating-system specific fixes are very welcome.
* When making a PR please make sure both the PR and the code is commented clearly for other book readers.
* Do not introduce code copy-pasted from elsewhere as there are licencing and copyright issues with this.
* Please do not submit CMakeLists.txt or build scripts for the entire book or for individual chapters. There is a specific chapter dedicated to introducing build systems.
* Please do not submit project or solution files for a particular IDE.
* Code in examples is copy-pasted from the book. If the PR needs to modify these please add a comment to those lines indicating why the change was important.
* Code style and language version changes are discouraged unless they fix a bug.
* If you are happy to be added to a contributors list then please add your name, as you would like it to appear, as a bullet at the bottom of this file.
